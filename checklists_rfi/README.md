Security will never be an exact science where a complete list of all possible issues that should be tested can de defined.

Checklists can be used to ensure consistency among both internal testing teams and external vendors.

These checklists offer tips for planning, issuing and reviewing Request for Information (RFI) documents for information security assessments.

Typical elements of an RFI document:

- About your organization / team: Outline the nature of your business, workforce size, location details, etc.

- RFI process: Clarify selection criteria, RFI timeline, submission guidelines, etc.

- Assessment requirements: Discuss assessment objectives, scope, your infrastructure details, etc.

- Assessment deliverables: Explain the expected deliverables, including reports and discussions

- Terms and conditions (if necessary): Include the text provided by your organization's legal and procurement teams

## Planning the security assessment RFI

- Understand what's driving your need for the security assessment, so you can be specific in the RFI

- Identify the individuals who should participate in the development of the RFI and in the review of responses

- Consider whether your environment is ready to be assessed, or whether it's best to wait

- Understand and confirm your staff's availability during the assessment to support the project

- Identify and avoid conflicts with other projects during the assessment (e.g., rollout of a new application)

- In the RFI, <b>describe the benefits of working with your organization to entice more vendors to respond</b>

- Consider requiring an NDA if an RFI responder asks for sensitive details for preparing a response

## Supporting the RFI process

- Decide on a realistic timeline for the RFI process, allocating sufficient time for a responses and review

- Confirm a realistic budget for the assessment, accounting for your requirements and market prices

- Clarify how the RFI responses should be submitted (email, wiki, etc.) and who will receive them

- Define the process for receiving timely answers to the questions you may have after reviewing RFI responses

- Request a commitment to respond by a specific date, so you know whether to expect a sufficient number of RFI responses; if necessary, invite additional responders

- What business and IT objectives, including compliance requirements, should the assessment support?

- What milestones and timeline (dates for starting, ending, performing testing, etc.) do you require?

- Communicate reports and other deliverables For reports, outline desired table of contents.)

- What type of a security assessment do you need (threat modeling, penetration testing, etc.)?
