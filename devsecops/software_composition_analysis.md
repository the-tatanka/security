# Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

It typically looks for a lock file then performs a build to fetch upstream dependency information. In the case of containers, Dependency Scanning uses the compatible manifest and reports only these declared software dependencies (and those installed as a sub-dependency). Dependency Scanning can not detect software dependencies that are pre-bundled into the containerâ€™s base image.

To identify pre-bundled dependencies, use Container Scanning.

<b>OWASP Dependency-Check</b> will be used to check for vulnerable dependencies.

- https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck

- Github action: https://github.com/dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action

- OWASP Dependency Check command line arguments (action calls Docker container from OWASP Dependency Check): https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-cli/arguments.html

## Integration

1. Enable code scanning in your repository.

2. Creat a new workflow named "dependency-check.yml" in your ".github/workflows" directory.

3. Paste the example Dependency-Check action below.

```
# For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing; you simply need
# to commit it to your repository.
#
# You may wish to alter this file to provide command line arguments:
# https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-cli/arguments.html
#
name: "Dependency-Check"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    # The branches below must be a subset of the branches above
    branches: [ main, master ]
    paths-ignore:
      - '**/*.md'
      - '**/*.txt'
  schedule:
    - cron: '28 15 * * 3'

  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read

      security-events: write

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository

    - name: Dependency Check
      uses: dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action@main
      with:
        project: "test"
        # Automatically searches for dependency manager files in the repository
        path: "."
        # Exports the results in SARIF format for SARIF upload.
        # Alternatively, other report formats can be selected, see command line arguments.
        format: "SARIF"
        # If results with a high severity are found, the workflow fails.
        args: >
          --failOnCVSS 7
          --enableRetired

    - name: Upload DependencyCheck output as artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
      with:
        name: dependency-check-report-sarif
        path: ${{ github.workspace }}/reports
      if: always()

    # Upload findings to GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard
    - name: Upload SARIF file for GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1
      with:
        # Path to SARIF file relative to the root of the repository
        sarif_file: ${{ github.workspace }}/reports/dependency-check-report.sarif
      if: always()
```

## Results evaluation

If vulnerable dependencies with a high severity are identified, they must be fixed immediately.

False positives or non-production relevant dependencies can be listed as findings. Therefore, an evaluation of the findings is required:

- Expert knowledge regarding the used software is necessary

- Is the dependency production relevant or is it only a development dependency?

- Can the dependency be removed completely because the dependency is not used?
