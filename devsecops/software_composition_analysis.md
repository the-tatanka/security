# Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

It typically looks for a lock file then performs a build to fetch upstream dependency information. In the case of containers, Dependency Scanning uses the compatible manifest and reports only these declared software dependencies (and those installed as a sub-dependency). Dependency Scanning can not detect software dependencies that are pre-bundled into the containerâ€™s base image.

To identify pre-bundled dependencies, use Container Scanning.

<b>OWASP Dependency-Check</b> will be used to check for vulnerable dependencies.

The <b>CycloneDX</b> module for Node.js is used to generate a Software Bill-of-Materials (BOM) containing an aggregate of all project dependencies.

- Github Action: https://github.com/CycloneDX/gh-node-module-generatebom

- Dev dependency: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyclonedx/bom

Only production dependencies are part of the BOM. The result is a JSON file called "bom.json".
