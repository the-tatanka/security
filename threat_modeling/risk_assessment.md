Risk is composed both of the impact when a risk is manifested as well as the likelihood that the risk will manifest. Impact can be assessed in a risk assessment and is primarily based on the data which the service handles. Likelihood on the other hand is primarily driven by the presence or absence of security controls in the service.

Risk is commonly defined as: <b>risk = impact \* likelihood</b>

For each identified threat, the risk must be assessed.

## Impact

Impact is the potential result that can be produced by the weakness, assuming that the weakness can be successfully reached and exploited.

Assessing impact is a relatively finite, quantitative exercise:

- define the maximum amount of how much money we might lose

- how badly our reputation would be damaged

- how many employees would be unable to work

- etc.

Risk impact generally does not change quickly over time unless services and products are redesigned, large features are added, new types of data is processed, etc.

See impact metric.

## Likelihood

The likelihood that a vulnerability in the service will be exploited in a calendar year due to the absence of security controls.

See likelihood metric.

## Risk

Risk is determined based on the risk metric - see risk metric.

Risk is commonly defined as: <b>risk = impact \* likelihood</b>
