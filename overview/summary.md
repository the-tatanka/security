Securing your applications against today’s cyber threats means facing a veritable jungle of products, services, and solutions - don’t leave home without a map.

This List outlines best practices to secure your applications.

Application security is a continuous journey. To do it effectively means building security into your software development life cycle without slowing down delivery times - turn this list into an action plan.

1. <b>Address security in architecture, design, and open source and third-party components.</b> If you’re only checking for bugs in your proprietary code or running penetration tests against your system, you’re likely missing a substantial number of the vulnerabilities in your software.

2. <b>Build a “DevSecOps toolbelt” that brings together the solutions needed to address your risks.</b> An effective DevSecOps toolbelt should include integrated solutions that address application security risks end-to-end, providing analysis of vulnerabilities in proprietary code, open source components, and runtime configuration and behavior.

3. <b>Develop a program (or team) to raise the level of DevSecOps competency in your organization.</b> Be sure you’re focusing on the actions that will have the biggest positive impact on your software security program at the least possible cost. Knowing what’s important requires a team of experienced security experts to analyze an application portfolio quickly and effectively and identify the specific risk profile for each app and its environment.

4. <b>Develop a structured plan to coordinate security initiative improvements with cloud migration.</b> Once you fully understand the risks, you can create a roadmap for your cloud migration to ensure all teams are in alignment and your priorities are clear.

5. <b>Establish security blueprints outlining security best practices.</b> Security blueprints can help guide development teams and systems integrators in building and deploying cloud applications more securely.
