# Security assessment / threat modeling

Who:

- Security expert(s)

- Project manager (must be there at the beginning and at the end)

- Developer(s)

What:

- Security assessment / threat modeling

When:

- It is best if this workshop is held during the design phase of the project

- Alternatively, it can take place later or before breaking releases

Where:

- In person or virtual

Why:

- Identify what the mission-critical, processing sensitive or valuable data is

- Identify potential threats and their risks

- Proposal for the treatment of risks

- Reduce the risk of threats by defining countermeasures

- Side benefit: update of the project documentation

How / OKRs:

1. Review / fill out the materials distributed prior to the workshop

- Hand over workshop materials prior to the workshop

- Go over each point of the materials during the workshop

- Each participant must agree to the entered data

2. Establish the scope

- Create an inventory of all components and data included

- Map them to architecture and data flow diagrams

- Each data / protocol type must be classified

3. Determine likely threats (assignment)

- Consider each component

- Prioritize components that process sensitive data

4. Rank each threat (assignment)

- Determine the level of risk each threat has by likelihood, impact, and a justification

- Prioritize the risks according to their criticality

5. Make suggestions on risk treatment options (assignment)

- Decide how to treat each threat (avoid, transfer, reduce, accept)

- Add a justification for each chosen risk treatment option

6. Create a security concept (assignment)

- Package all information in a document, see section "Security Concept"

- Use a document standard (so future changes to the application, threat landscape and operating environment can be quickly assessed), see section "Security Concept"

- Hand over encrypted security concept to project manager
