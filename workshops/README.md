# Workshop planning

Anyone who has ever planned a workshop will tell you that it's a big job.

Workshops are great for security assessments, interactive learning, and problem-solving. Planning in advance is critical.

The general procedure is always the same:

1. Research your audience

2. Pick a date

3. Set meeting goals - share them

4. Warm up

5. Agenda - send it out ahead of time together with workshop materials

6. Follow up - saying thank you, make assignments
